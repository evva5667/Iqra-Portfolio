                            <p>I'm Iqra Bano, a product designer with a multidisciplinary background that spans computer engineering, psychological research, and interactive design. My journey has been driven by a curiosity to understand how people interact with technology and how I can make those interactions more meaningful and intuitive. I'm passionate about working at the intersection of design and emerging technologies to craft compelling stories and experiences.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>From co-founding a startup in Lahore to conducting VR research at NYU Abu Dhabi, I've always been drawn to challenges that push creative and technical boundaries. My work in spiking neural networks and visual cognition has given me a unique perspective on building intelligent and human-centered products. When I'm not designing, you can find me doodling, exploring new narrative forms, or planning my next trip.</p>

The concept of Camp Jened was revolutionary at the time, and it's fascinating to see how the campers, who later became pioneers of the disability rights movement, were instrumental in driving such monumental change.</p>
                        <p>What struck me most was the enduring camaraderie among the campers. They demonstrated to the world that their disabilities wouldn't stop them from making significant contributions, even going as far as to ensure legislation was passed to protect their rights. The sense of fulfillment and achievement in their eyes when Section 504 was passed was truly moving. I think the documentary does an excellent job of portraying these individuals simply as people. A moment that particularly resonated with me was when John asked Michael Tannenbaum what he loved about Camp Jened. Michael's response‚Äîthat the staff didn't treat them like they were babysitting them, unlike other camps‚Äîhighlighted the respect and dignity afforded to them at Jened, which was fundamentally different from their experiences elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The activists' brilliance was also highlighted by their ability to bring Manhattan to a standstill by blocking a single street. This determination was really inspiring. Although I've never participated in a demonstration, seeing their steadfast resolve was a lesson in the power of advocacy, I loved it. I remember while watching it one interviewee's comment really stuck with me: "We want people who will not accept 'no' without asking 'why.'" And I think this philosophy is such a powerful call to action, reminding me of the importance of persistence and inquisitive engagement, like they know what they are asking for.</p>
                        <p>There were also incredible instances of resourcefulness and solidarity which were really emotional for me to watch them. For example, when the FBI cut off their telephone connections, the response from the deaf community was ingenious. And the story of the individual who improvised a refrigerator using just cardboard and an air conditioner is a testament to the innovative spirit that permeated their movement.</p>
                        <p>I would say in short, this documentary is more than just a film; it's a compelling reminder of the impact that a united group of people can have on society, challenging us to question, to support, and to act. And made me wonder are those people <em>disable</em> or the world were have created is not <em>able enough</em> to make their lives easier.</p>

                        <h3>Accessibility to digital Technology: Virtual barriers and real opportunities</h3>
                        <p>One key takeaway from the article about digital technology accessibility is that the true barrier for people with disabilities often lies in the proprietary and closed nature of the underlying protocols and standards. This understanding didn't come to me immediately; it emerged as I delved deeper into recent updates and developments in the tech world, revealing more systemic issues.</p>
                        <p>A recurring problem in digital technology‚Äîspanning operating systems, applications, and websites‚Äîis that while initial accessibility issues might be addressed, they frequently resurface with every new update or version. I think when iOS 13 was released in September 2019, it introduced bugs that disrupted VoiceOver, touch sensitivity, and Bluetooth connectivity for accessibility devices, causing issues for users with disabilities. After receiving feedback from the disability community, Apple quickly addressed these issues in updates starting with iOS 13.1.3, restoring functionality and improving the overall user experience for affected individuals. Its like a garden with a pathway specifically designed for wheelchair access. Initially, the pathway is wide and clear, accommodating everyone. However, now someone decided to upgrade the garden, and the workers, focusing on aesthetics rather than function, inadvertently place decorations that narrow the path, obstructing wheelchair access.</p>
                        <p>This garden is like a software and digital products. The pathway's initial design was accessible, but without ongoing oversight focused on maintaining this accessibility‚Äîakin to the garden designer's original intent‚Äîupgrades can reintroduce barriers. In the digital world, these upgrades are software updates that may not be overseen by those who are mindful of accessibility needs.</p>
                        <p>I like how author highlights that digital accessibility issues tend to re-emerge because the development process itself often doesn't prioritize accessibility as a fundamental component. It might be that a capitalist mindset is at play here, where companies prioritize updates and features that cater to the majority of their consumers who don't require accessibility options, leading to less attention on making products accessible for all.</p>
                        <p>Just to keep it short now, I think reflection has not only helped me understand the complexities of digital accessibility but also the importance of viewing technology development as an ongoing process that should inclusively cater to all users.</p>

                        <h3>What flying is like for those who use wheelchairs</h3>
                        <p>Reflecting on the article, I am struck by the emotional weight of the narrative. The challenges that come with navigating air travel as a wheelchair user are not merely inconveniences but profound barriers that deeply impact one's dignity and autonomy. It is heartrending to consider the reality faced by individuals like Charles Brown, who must endure such trials regularly. I think this story serves as a reminder of the urgent need for empathetic understanding and meaningful action in our approach to accessibility. It compels me to look beyond our own experiences and recognize the importance of designing systems that truly accommodate everyone with respect and consideration.</p>

            <p>This project helped me transform a deeply personal moment into something interactive and shareable. The souvenir card feature was particularly meaningful ‚Äî it allowed users to leave with something tangible, making the experience more than just a passive film viewing. The challenge of balancing emotional storytelling with technical functionality taught me valuable lessons about user experience design in multimedia contexts.</p>
            <p>Looking back, I would have loved to incorporate more user testing to understand how different audiences connect with the content, and perhaps explore additional interactive elements that could deepen the emotional engagement.</p>

                    <h3>Creative Solutions</h3>
                    <p>Used a dormitory trolley as a makeshift dolly for smooth camera movements. Coordinated team movements and placed soft fabric under the tripod to reduce vibrations.</p>

            <h2>User Testing & Reflection</h2>
            <p>User testing was crucial in refining the interactive elements. We focused on creating an intuitive navigation system that felt natural and unobtrusive, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the story without being distracted by the interface. The final result is a reflective experience that invites viewers to explore their own memories of transition and change.</p>

            <h2>Impact & Results</h2>
            <p>The project successfully created an emotionally engaging interactive experience that brought together storytelling, visual production, and user interaction. The collaborative approach allowed each team member to contribute their strengths while learning new skills in multimedia production.</p>
            <p>The interactive web component enhanced the film's emotional impact by giving viewers agency in the narrative, making them active participants rather than passive observers. This approach demonstrated how digital media can be used to explore complex emotional themes in innovative ways.</p>
